# Groundwater Level Prediction using LSTM, CNN, and CatBoost

A comparative machine learning study for forecasting post-monsoon groundwater levels.  
This project evaluates three models (LSTM, CNN, and CatBoost) on real groundwater data and analyzes how accurately each predicts observed values.

The goal is to support early detection of groundwater stress, improve resource planning, and assist in water-management decisions.

## Key Objectives

- Predict groundwater levels for different regions post-monsoon  
- Compare deep learning models (LSTM, CNN) with CatBoost  
- Identify which model is most accurate and stable across all ranges

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is **UPVillageSchedule.csv**, obtained from the 6th Minor Irrigation Census — Village Schedule of Uttar Pradesh (India).  
This dataset originates from a government-led national survey that records village-level irrigation, water resources, and allied data.

[6th Minor Irrigation Census – Village Schedule (UPVillageSchedule.csv)](https://www.data.gov.in/catalog/6th-minor-irrigation-census-village-schedule-ground-water-schemes-surface-water-schemes) 

You can download the dataset from the above link and place it inside the `data/` folder before running the notebook.

The red dashed line in each figure represents the ideal fit (y = x).
Points closer to this line indicate more accurate predictions.


## Evaluation Insights

All three models follow the ideal line reasonably well.  
CNN and CatBoost show strong alignment with the ideal fit, especially at higher groundwater levels.  
LSTM performs well but shows slightly higher variance at extreme values.

### In summary:

- For **stability and consistency**, CNN and CatBoost are preferable.  
- For **sequential pattern learning**, LSTM remains useful, especially when trained on more time steps/features.
